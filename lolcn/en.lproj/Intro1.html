The Steam Workshop allows artists in the community to create and upload content to be a part of the game. They receive a portion of each sale of that item. In Team Fortress 2, over $3.5 million has been paid out to Workshop contributors since the system went live in Fall of 2010.

We solve that in a simple way, the game is free, all the Heroes are free, and items are earnable in-game. That means, you'll never have to pay to play and win at Dota.
